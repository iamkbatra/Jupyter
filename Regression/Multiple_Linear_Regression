Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure.
The dataset is taken from Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction abbreviated as CASP 5-9.

Attribute Information:
RMSD  - Size of the residue.
F1    - Total surface area.
F2    - Non polar exposed area.
F3    - Fractional area of exposed non polar residue.
F4    - Fractional area of exposed non polar part of residue.
F5    - Molecular mass weighted exposed area.
F6    - Average deviation from standard exposed area of residue.
F7    - Euclidian distance.
F8    - Secondary structure penalty.
F9    - Spacial Distribution constraints (N,K Value).
