Benchmarking the Performance of Time Dependent Density Functional Methods for UV/Vis Spectal Properties of Porphyins and their Derivatives
The DFT simulated geometery optimization of 12 porphyin molecules. Each molecule is tested with 100+ time dependent functional methods /including CIS 
to calculate their absorption wavelength (nm). In literature their experimental absorption wavelengths for each compound is already reported. Task is to 
thoroughly benchmark the performance of functional methods and find out which method is the best to reproduce the absorption wavelengths for all compounds 
with minimum error and could be useful in future to predict the absorption wavelength of new related compounds.
