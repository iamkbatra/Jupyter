Assay's raw output from one sample is a set of fluorescence vs time curves. Each curve typically starts fairly level, rises, then levels off, 
earlier when the target mutation is present than when it is absent. This data represents an experiment comparing three versions of the assay 
('ConditionA', 'ConditionB', 'ConditionC'). Each version has the same 32 target mutations, and is tested on the same 32 known and 16 unknown samples. 
Task is to identify the mutations in the known and unknown samples and assess which of the 3 assay versions is best overall.
